# FightGame
A small Minecraft Pluging to implement simple duels

/!\ This plugin was developped for an utilization between french people, so all messages and a part of the comments are in french

For now, only one place for duels can be set up. This plugin was mainly made to improve PVP skills with a friend without caring of the stuff and the regeneration.
To make it work, you will need to first add the spawn locations with the command /fightgame addspawn. As it is a duel, the cap is 2 spawns. You will also need to create a sign with <join> on the first ligne. Then, to indicate where the sign is (and thus where the players will respawn when the fight is done) you will need to use /fightgame setsign.
You can list and remove spawns, but not signs at the moment.
